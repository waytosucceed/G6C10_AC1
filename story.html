                    In the previous two classes we studied altogether four types of adverbs namely: <br>
                   1. Adverbs of Place &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Adverbs of Time <br>

            var para=["In the previous class, we read that two school-going girls usually interacted with each other from either side of the road while waiting for their school buses through the exchange of smiles and hand gestures. One morning, Daisy saw Dora crying, and she initiated a conversation to know why Dora was sad. After their first conversation, Daisy came to know that Dora could not find her cat, which was the last gift from her grandmother. Daisy, being kind and polite, offered to help Dora search for the lost cat. <br> <br>Today, we will continue from the point where Dora informs Daisy that her cat never leaves the house when sick and that her entire family could not find it even after a rigorous search.",

                      "<span style='font-weight: bolder;background-color: blueviolet;color: white;'>Daisy</span>:  I am completely sure he must be somewhere in your house. My father is a veterinary doctor. He loves cats and keeps telling me about cat behaviours. Tell me something Dora, is your cat sociable enough? <br> <br> <span style='font-weight: bolder;background-color: blueviolet;color: white;'> DORA </span>: Yes, he is.",

                      "<span style='font-weight: bolder;background-color: blueviolet;color: white;'>DAISY</span>: sociable cats usually withdraw from any kind of interaction when sick and they try not to move from their known space. You said that your cat is sociable and never leaves the house when sick; therefore, he must be in your house or within the boundary of your house.<br><br> <i> Pointing at a house in the distance,</i> Dora said: <br><br>   <span style='font-weight: bolder;background-color: blueviolet;color: white;'>  DORA</span>: That’s the house in which I live Daisy. Please come with me.<br><br> <span style='font-weight: bolder;background-color: blueviolet;color: white;'> DAISY </span>: I have to go northwards to reach home. My mother will be waiting for me. I need to inform her.",

                      "Dora’s cat being social and never leaving the house when sick helped Daisy reach the conclusion that the cat is within the house because social cats do not leave their known space when unwell. The word <u> <span style='font-weight: bolder;color: blueviolet;'> ‘therefore’ </span></u> helps Daisy build that cause-and-effect relation between the facts.<u> <span style='color: blueviolet;'> ‘Therefore’ is a conjunctive adverb. </span></u> <br> <br> <span style='font-weight: bolder;'> In a sentence, <u> conjunctive adverbs </u> join clauses together, forming relations between expressions such as addition, contrast, and order.</span> Conjunctive adverbs also help us express the sense of <span style='font-weight: bolder;font-style:italic;'> emphasis, clarification, comparison and consequence.</span>",
